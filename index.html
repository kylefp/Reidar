    <div id="mission">
        <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to grow the size of the Reidar DAO treasury by investing in blue-chip digital assets and protocols achieving outsized risk-adjusted returns.
                We take an activist view of investing in the sense that our goal is not to just achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, but we also endeavour to provide value to the projects that we invest in.</p>     
    </div>

    <div id="history">
        <h1>History</h1>
        <h2>The Genesis of Reidar Dao:</h2>
        <p>Reidar DAO originated from a discord server set-up by a group of Canadian friends, the goal of which was to share resources relevant to investing and web3. The server naturally progressed towards a more refined focus in evaluating specific investment opportunities as the server's members grew their personal portfolios from early calls such as buying into the Bored Ape Yacht Club at under 1 ETH, investing in Solana at $40, Fantom at around $0.40, VeeFriends at launch, and many more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As the portfolios of the members grew, so did the Discord’s membership. We didn’t promote the discord or open it up to the masses, but we encouraged our members to invite others that they thought would be a good fit for the community.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Over the last few months, discussions of shifting towards a dao model were undertaken and a dao structure began to form. Our goal was to leverage economies of scale and take advantage of the efficient pooling of capital associated with daos to make high quality digital investments that normally would be out of reach for the average web3 user.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We wanted to keep the dao highly accessible and efficient so we turned away 100+ interested applicants for our first round. Instead choosing to raise 90 eth from the existing membership at a minimum investment of 0.1 eth with an average investment of 1.08 ETH</p>
        <br>
        <p>On November 28th, 2021, we acquired our first digital asset. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Looking towards the future, we plan to expand the dao in a sustainable manner and bringing in more high-quality members and investing in the web3 ecosystem. We have a rough expectation that the next funding round will open in 3-5 weeks.</p>

        <h1>Get Involved</h1>
        <p>We believe that one of our competitive advantages is derived from having a curated group of highly motivated individuals. As a consequence, membership in Reidar DAO is by invitation only. We are currently accepting indications of interest, for our second group of dao members. We want to continue bringing in the brightest, most interesting, and motivated people from the web3 space and beyond. If this sounds like you, we would invite you to complete our interest form and your application will be considered over the next couple weeks by our membership committee, who will determine if you will be invited to join us during our next funding round.</p>
